\chapter{Therminator model}
  \verb|THERMINATOR|~\cite{therminator} is a Monte Carlo event generator designed to investigate the particle production in the relativistic heavy ion collisions.
  The functionality of the code includes a generation of the stable particles and unstable resonances at the chosen hypersurface model.
  It performs the statistical hadronization which is followed by space-time evolution of particles and the decay of resonances.
  The key element of this method is an inclusion of a complete list of hadronic resonances.
  The second version of \verb|THERMINATOR|~\cite{therminator2} comes with a posibility to incorporate any shape of freeze-out hypersurface and the expansion velocity field, especially those generated externally with various hydrodynamic codes.

  \section{Statistical hadronization}
  % ========
    Statistical description of heavy ion collision has been successfully used to describe quantitatively \textit{soft} physics, i.e. the regime with the transverse momentum not exceeding 2 GeV.
    The assumption that hadronic matter before rapid expansion reaches equilibrium, leads to good results in particle abundances measured in heavy ion experiments, in particular, at the high energies.
    At the rather high temperature of the freeze-out $\approx$140-160 MeV, the resonances contribute very significantly to the observables.
    Therefore, the crucial element for the success of the statistical approach is the complete inclusion of hadronic resonances~\cite{therminator}.
