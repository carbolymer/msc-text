\chapter{Scripts for events generation}
% ========
  In order to perform analysis with sufficient statistics, a large amount of generated events was required.
  To handle this task of generation large amount of data, a computer cluster at Faculty of Physics at Warsaw University of Technology was used.
  This cluster consists of 20 nodes with the following hardware configuration: \mbox{Intel\textregistered} \mbox{Core\texttrademark~2 Quad} CPU \mbox{Q6600 @ 2.40GHz,} \mbox{8GB RAM} with Scientific~Linux~5.8.
  To execute many \verb|THERMINATOR| processes, TORQUE~\cite{torque} Resource Manager was used.
