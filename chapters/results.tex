\chapter{Results}
  For the purposes of the femtoscopic analysis, events were generated using \verb|THERMINATOR| model for eight different sets of initial conditions corresponding the following centrality ranges: 0-5\%, 0-10\%, 10-20\%, 20-30\%, 30-40\%, 40-50\%, 50-60\% and 60-70\% for the Pb-Pb collisions at the centre of mass energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}~=~2.76$~TeV.

  \section{Identical particles correlations}
  % ========
    The correlation functions (three-dimensional and one-dimensional) were calculated separately for the following different pairs of identical particles: $\pi$-$\pi$, $K$-$K$ and  $p$-$p$ for nine $k_T$ bins (in GeV/c): 0.1-0.2, 0.2-0.3, 0.3-0.4, 0.4-0.5, 0.6-0.7, 0.7-0.8, 0.8-1.0 and 1.0-1.2.
    In case of kaons, $k_T$ ranges start from 0.3 and for pions from 0.4 and for both of them the maximum value is 1.0.
    The $k_T$ ranges for the heavier particles were limited to maintain sufficient multiplicity to perform reliable calculations.

      The three-dimensional correlation functions as functions of relative momentum $q_{LCMS}$ were calculated in a form of spherical harmonics components series accordingly to the Eq.~\ref{eq:sh_decomposition}.
      In the femtoscopic analysis of identical particles, the most important information is stored in the $\Re C^0_0$, $\Re C^0_2$ and $\Re C^2_2$.
      Correlation functions obtained in this procedure for different centrality bins for the pairs of pions, kaons and protons are presented in the Fig.~\ref{fig:cf3dpi}, \ref{fig:cf3dk} and \ref{fig:cf3dp}.
      
      Coefficients for pairs of identical bosons (pions and kaons) are shown in the Fig.~\ref{fig:cf3dpi} and \ref{fig:cf3dk}.
      The increase of a correlation in the low momenta regime is clearly visible in the $\Re C^0_0$ component and has its source in the Bose-Einstein statistics.
      The $\Re C_0^0$ resembles one-dimensional correlation function and in fact it encodes information about overall source radius.
      The second coefficient $\Re C^0_2$ differs from zero (is negative), which yields the information about the ratio $R_T / R_{long}$.
      The $\Re C^2_2$ stores the $R_{out} / R_{side}$ ratio and one can notice that is non-vanishing (is also negative).

      The correlation function for a pair of identical fermions is in the Fig.~\ref{fig:cf3dp}.
      An influence of Fermi-Dirac statistics has its effect in the decrease of a correlation down to 0.5 at low relative momentum, which can be observed in $\Re C^0_0$.
      The $\Re C^0_2$ and $\Re C^2_2$ coefficients differ from zero and become positive.

      The common effect for the spherical harmonics form of a correlation function is the ``mirroring'' of the shape of the $\Re C^0_0$ coefficient - when correlation function decreases, the $\Re C^0_2$ and $\Re C^2_2$ are becoming positive and vice versa.
      This is quite different behaviour than in the case of correlations of non-identical particles, where the $\Re C^0_2$ still behaves in the same manner, but $\Re C_2^2$ has the opposite sign to the $\Re C^0_2$~\cite{nonidfemto}.

      In all cases, the correlation function gets wider with the peripherality of a collision i.e. the correlation function for most central collisions (0-10\%) is much narrower than for the most peripheral ones (60-70\%).
      This phenomena in clearly visible the $\Re C^0_0$ coefficients.
      Other components are also affected by this effect, this is especially noticeable in the case of kaons and pions.
      For the protons, the results are noisy, hence this effect is not distinguishable.

      % The quantitative analysis of the trends in the shape (described by the femtoscopic radii) of a three-dimensional correlation function is performed in the next section of this chapter.

    \subsection{Centrality dependence of a correlation function}
    % ========
      The centrality dependence of a correlation function is especially visible in one-dimensional correlation functions.
      This effect is presented in the Fig.~\ref{fig:centr_dep} - the width is smaller in the most central collisions.
      Hence, the femtoscopic radii (proportional to the inverse of width) is increasing with the centrality.
      An explanation for this growth is that in the most central collisions, a size of a created system is larger than for the peripheral ones.

    \subsection{$k_T$ dependence of a correlation function}
    % ========
      In the Fig.~\ref{fig:kt_dep} there are presented one-dimensional correlation functions for pions, kaons and protons for the same centrality bin, but different $k_T$ ranges.
      One can observe in all cases of the particle types, appearance of the same trend: with the increase of the total transverse momentum of a pair, the width of a correlation function increases and the femtoscopic radius decreases.
      The plots in the Fig.~\ref{fig:kt_dep} were zoomed in to show the influence of $k_T$.

  \section{Results of the fitting procedure}
  % ========
  In order to perform a quantitative analysis of a wide range of correlation functions, the theoretical formulas were fitted to the calculated experimental-like data.
  In this procedure, the femtoscopic radii for the three-dimensional as well as one-dimensional correlation functions were extracted.

    \subsection{Femtoscopic radii scaling with the transverse mass}
    % ========
      The main goal of this analysis is a verification of a transverse mass scaling of different particles types.
      The radii are plotted as a function of a transverse mass $m_T = \sqrt{k_T^2 +m^2}$ and the following power-law is fitted:
      \begin{equation}
        R_x = \alpha {m_T}^{-\beta}~,
      \end{equation}
      where the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are free parameters.

      In the Fig.~\ref{fig:piradii} there are femtoscopic radii in the outward, sideward and longitudinal direction of the analysis of two-pion correlation functions in LCMS.
      The dashed lines are fits of the power law to the data.
      The results for the top 5\% central collisions (star-shaped markers in the Fig.~\ref{fig:piradii}) are with the good agreement with the experimental data from ALICE~\cite{alice_pion}.
