\chapter{Results}
  For the purposes of the femtoscopic analysis, events were generated using \verb|THERMINATOR| model for eight different sets of initial conditions corresponding the following centrality ranges: 0-5\%, 0-10\%, 10-20\%, 20-30\%, 30-40\%, 40-50\%, 50-60\% and 60-70\% for the Pb-Pb collisions at the centre of mass energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}~=~2.76$~TeV.

  \section{Identical particles correlations}
  % ========
    The correlation functions were calculated separately for the following different pairs of identical particles: $\pi$-$\pi$, $K$-$K$ and  $p$-$p$ for nine $k_T$ bins (in GeV/c): 0.1-0.2, 0.2-0.3, 0.3-0.4, 0.4-0.5, 0.6-0.7, 0.7-0.8, 0.8-1.0 and 1.0-1.2.
    In case of kaons, $k_T$ ranges start from 0.3 and for pions from 0.4 and for both of them the maximum value is 1.0.
    The $k_T$ ranges for the heavier particles were limited to maintain sufficient multiplicity to perform reliable calculations.

      The three-dimensional correlation functions as functions of relative momentum $q_{LCMS}$ were calculated in a form of spherical harmonics components series accordingly to the Eq.~\ref{eq:sh_decomposition}.
      In the femtoscopic analysis of identical particles, the most important information is stored in the $\Re C^0_0$, $\Re C^0_2$ and $\Re C^2_2$.
      Correlation functions obtained in this procedure for different centrality bins for the pairs of pions, kaons and protons are presented in the Fig.~\ref{fig:cf3dpi}, \ref{fig:cf3dk} and \ref{fig:cf3dp}.
      
      Coefficients for pairs of identical bosons (pions and kaons) are shown in the Fig.~\ref{fig:cf3dpi} and \ref{fig:cf3dk}.
      The increase of a correlation in the low momenta regime is clearly visible in the $\Re C^0_0$ component and has its source in the Bose-Einstein statistics.
      The $\Re C_0^0$ resembles one-dimensional correlation function and in fact it encodes information about overall source radius.
      The second coefficient $\Re C^0_2$ differs from zero (is negative), which yields the information about the ratio $R_T / R_{long}$.
      The $\Re C^2_2$ stores the $R_{out} / R_{side}$ ratio and one can notice that is non-vanishing (is also negative).

      The correlation function for a pair of identical fermions is in the Fig.~\ref{fig:cf3dp}.
      An influence of Fermi-Dirac statistics has its effect in the decrease of a correlation down to 0.5 at low relative momentum, which can be observed in $\Re C^0_0$.
      The $\Re C^0_2$ and $\Re C^2_2$ coefficients differ from zero and become positive.

      The common effect for the spherical harmonics form of a correlation function is the ``mirroring'' of the shape of the $\Re C^0_0$ coefficient - when correlation function decreases, the $\Re C^0_2$ and $\Re C^2_2$ are becoming positive and vice versa.
      This is quite different behaviour than in the case of correlations of non-identical particles, where the $\Re C^0_2$ still behaves in the same manner, but $\Re C_2^2$ has the opposite sign to the $\Re C^0_2$~\cite{nonidfemto}.

      In all cases, the correlation function gets wider with the peripherality of a collision.
      This phenomena is clearly visible in the $\Re C^0_0$.
      Other components are also affected by this effect, this is especially noticeable in the case of kaons and pions.
      For the protons, the results are noisy, hence it is not clearly visible.

      The quantitative analysis of the trends in the shape (described by the femtoscopic radii) of a three-dimensional correlation function is performed in the next section of this chapter.
