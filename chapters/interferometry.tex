\chapter{Particle interferometry}
% ========
  Two-particle interferometry (also called \textit{femtoscopy}) gives a possibility to investigate space-time characteristics of the particle-emitting source created in heavy ion collisions.
  Through the study of particle correlations, their momentum distributions can be used to obtain information about the spatial extent of the created system.
  Using this method, one can measure sizes of the order of $10^{-15}$ m and time of the order of $10^{-23}$ s.

  \section{HBT interferometry}
  % ========
    In the 1956 Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss proposed a method which through analysis of interference between photons allowed to investigate angular dimensions of stars.
    The most important result from the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss experiments is that two indistinguishable particles can produce an interference effect.
    There is almost no difference between normal interferometry and HBT method, except that the latter one does not take into account information about phase shift of registered particles.
    At the beginning this method was used in astronomy for photon interference, but this effect can be used also to measure extent of any emitting source.
    This method was adapted to heavy ion collisions to investigate dimensions of a system created in those collisions by studying correlations of identical particles~\cite{nonidfemto}.
    The main difference between HBT method in astronomy and femtoscopy is that the first one is based on space-time HBT correlations and the latter one uses momentum correlations.
    The momentum correlations yield the space-time picture of the source, whereas the space-time HBT correlations provide the characteristic relative momenta of emitted photons, which gives the angular size of the star without the knowledge of its radius and lifetime~\cite{florkowski}.

  \section{Theoretical approach}
  % ========
    Intensity interferometry in heavy ion physics uses similar mathematical formalism as the astronomy HBT measurement.
    Through the measurement of correlation between particles as a function of their relative momentum one can deduce the average separation between emitting sources.

    \subsection{Conventions used}
    % ========
      In heavy ion collisions to describe particular directions, components of momentum and location of particles, one uses naming convention called the Bertsch-Pratt coordinate system.
      This system is presented in the Fig.~\ref{fig:coordinate-system}.
      \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{coordinate_system}
        \caption{Bertsch-Pratt direction naming convention used in heavy ion collision.}
        \label{fig:coordinate-system}
      \end{figure}
      The three directions are called \textit{longitudinal}, \textit{outward} and \textit{sideward}.
      The longitudinal direction is parallel to the beam axis.
      The plane perpendicular to the beam axis is called a \textit{transverse plane}.
      A projection of a particle pair momentum $\vect{k} = (\vect{p}_a + \vect{p}_b)/2$ on a transverse plane (a \textit{transverse momentum} $\vect{k}_T$) determines \textit{outward} direction: $(\vect{k})_{out} = \vect{k}_T$.
      A direction perpendicular to the longitudinal and outward is called \textit{sideward}.

      A particle pair is usually described using two coordinate systems.
      The first one, \textit{Longitudinally Co-Moving System} (\textbf{LCMS}) is moving along the particle pair with the longitudinal direction, in other words, the pair longitudinal momentum vanishes: $(\vect{p}_a)_{long} = -(\vect{p}_b)_{long} $.
      The second system is called \textit{Pair Rest Frame} (\textbf{PRF}).
      In the PRF the centre of mass rests: $\vect{p}_a = -\vect{p}_b$.
      Variables which are expressed in the PRF are marked with a star (e.g. $\vect{k}^{*}$).

      The transition of space-time coordinates from LCMS to PRF is simply a boost along the outward direction, with the transverse velocity of the pair~$\beta_t = (\vect{v}/c)_{out}$~\cite{nonidfemto}:
      \begin{align}
        \label{eq:lcmstoprf}
        r^{*}_{out} &= \gamma_{t}(r_{out} - \beta_{t} \Delta t)\\
        r^{*}_{side} &= r_{side}\\
        r^{*}_{long} &= r_{long}\\
        \Delta t^{*} &= \gamma_{t}(\Delta t - \beta_{t} r_{out})~,
      \end{align}
      where $\gamma_{t} = (1-\beta^{2}_{t})^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor.
      However, in calculations performed in this work the equal time approximation is used, which assumes that particles in a pair were produced at the same time in PRF - the $\Delta t^{*}$ is neglected.

      The most important variables used to describe particle pair are their total momentum $\vect{P} = \vect{p}_a + \vect{p}_b$ and relative momentum $\vect{q} = \vect{p_a} - \vect{p_b}$.
      In the PRF one has $\vect{q} = 2 \vect{k}^{*}$, where $\vect{k}^{*}$ is a momentum of the first particle in PRF.

    \subsection{Two particle wave function}
    % ========
      Let us consider two identical particles with momenta $\vect{p_1}$ and $\vect{p_2}$ emitted from space points $\vect{x_1}$ and $\vect{x_2}$.
      Those emitted particles can be treated as two incoherent waves.
      \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{wavefunction}
        \caption{The pair wave function is a superposition of all possible states. In case of particle interferometry it includes two cases: particles with momenta $p_1$,~$p_2$ registered by detectors \textit{A}, \textit{B} and $p_1$,~$p_2$ registered by \textit{B}, \textit{A} respectively.}
        \label{fig:wavefunction}
      \end{figure}
      If the particles are identical, they are also indistinguishable, therefore one has also take into account the scenario, where the particle with momentum $\vect{p_1}$ is emitted from $\vect{x_2}$ and particle $\vect{p_2}$ from $\vect{x_1}$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:wavefunction}).
      In such case, the wave function describing behaviour of a pair has to contain both components~\cite{drkisiel}:
      \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:wavefunction}
        \Psi_{ab}(\vect{q})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \exp(- i \vect{p_1}\vect{x_1} - i \vect{p_2}\vect{x_2}) \pm \exp(- i \vect{p_2}\vect{x_1} - i \vect{p_1}\vect{x_2}) \right]~.
      \end{equation}
      A two particle wave function of identical bosons is symmetric (``+'' sign in Eq.~\ref{eq:wavefunction}) and in case of identical fermions - antisymmetric (``-'' sign).
      This anti-symmetrization or symmetrization implies the correlation effect coming from the Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein statistics accordingly.

      To provide full description of a system consisting of two charged hadrons, one has to include in the wave function besides quantum statistics also Coulomb and strong Final State Interactions.
      Considering identical particles systems, the quantum statistics is a main source of a correlation.
      Hence, in case of space-time analysis of particle emitting source, effects coming from the Coulomb and Strong interactions can be neglected.
    %
    % ========
    \subsection{Source emission function}
    % ========
      To describe particle emitting source, one uses a single emission function~\cite{nonidfemto}:
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:source-single-3d}
        S_A(\vect{x}_1,\vect{p}_1) = \int S(\vect{x}_1,\vect{p}_1,\vect{x}_2,\vect{p}_2,...,\vect{x}_N,\vect{p}_N)
        d \vect{x}_2 d \vect{p}_2 ... d \vect{x}_N d \vect{p}_N
      \end{equation}
      and a two-particle one:
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:source-two-3d}
        S_{AB}(\vect{x}_1,\vect{p}_1,\vect{x}_2,\vect{p}_2) = \int S(\vect{x}_1,\vect{p}_1,\vect{x}_2,\vect{p}_2,...,\vect{x}_N,\vect{p}_N)
        d \vect{x}_3 d \vect{p}_3 ... d \vect{x}_N d \vect{p}_N~.
      \end{equation}
      Emission function $S(\cdot)$ can be interpreted as a probability to emit a particle, or a pair of particles from a given space-time point with a given momentum.
      In principle, the source emission function should encode all physics aspects of the particle emission process i.e. the symmetrization for bosons and fermions, as well as the two-body and many body Final State Interactions.
      Instead of this, one assume that each particle's emission process is independent - the interaction between final-state particles after their creation is independent from their emission process.
      The assumption of this independence allows to construct two-particle emission function from single particle emission functions via a convolution~\cite{nonidfemto}:
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:source-two-conv}
        \begin{split}
          S(\vect{k}^{*},\vect{r}^{*}) = \int S_A ( \vect{p}_1, \vect{x}_1 ) S_B ( \vect{p}_2, \vect{x}_2 )
          \delta \left[\vect{k}^{*} - \frac{\vect{p}_1+\vect{p}_2}{2} \right]
          \delta \left[\vect{r}^{*} - (\vect{x}_1+\vect{x}_2) \right] \\
          \times~d^4 \vect{x}_1 d^4 \vect{x}_2 d^4 \vect{x}_1 d^3 \vect{p}_1 d^3 \vect{p}_2
        \end{split}
      \end{equation}
      In case of identical particles, ($S_A = S_B$) several simplifications can be made.
      A convolution of the two same Gaussian distributions is also a Gaussian distribution with $\sigma$ multiplied by $\sqrt{2}$.
      Femtoscopy can give information only about two-particle emission function, but when considering Gaussian distribution as a source function in Eq.~\ref{eq:source-two-conv}, one can obtain a $\sigma$ of a single emission function from a two-particle emission function.
      The Eq.~\ref{eq:source-two-conv} is not reversible - an information about $S_A(\cdot)$ cannot be derived from $S_{AB}(\cdot)$.
      An exception from this rule is a Gaussian source function, hence it is often used in femtoscopic calculations.
      Considering pairs of identical particles, an emission function is assumed to be described by the following equation in the Pair Rest Frame~\cite{nonidfemto}:
      \begin{equation}
        S^{PRF}_{1D} (\vect{r}^{*}) = \exp \left( - \frac{ {r_{out}^*}^{2} + {r_{side}^*}^{2} + {r_{long}^*}^{2}}{4 {R_{inv}}^2} \right)~.
      \end{equation}
      To change from the three-dimensional variables to the one-dimensional variable one requires introduction of the proper Jacobian~${r^*}^2$:
      \begin{empheq}[innerbox=\fbox, right=~.]{align}
        \label{eq:source-1d-prf}
        S^{PRF}_{1D} (r^{*}) = {r^*}^{2} \exp \left( - \frac{{r^*}^{2}}{4 {R_{inv}}^2} \right)
      \end{empheq}
      The ``4'' in the denominator before the ``standard deviation'' $R_{inv}$ in the Gaussian distribution comes from the convolution of the two Gaussian distributions, which multiplies the $R_{inv}$ by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

      A more complex form of emission function was used by all RHIC and SPS experiments in identical pion femtoscopy:
      \begin{empheq}[innerbox=\fbox, right=~.]{align}
        \label{eq:source-3d-lcms}
        S^{LCMS}_{3D} (\vect{r}) = \exp \left( 
          - \frac{ r_{out}^{2}}{4 {R_{out}}^2}
          - \frac{ r_{side}^{2}}{4 {R_{side}}^2}
          - \frac{ r_{long}^{2}}{4 {R_{long}}^2}
        \right)
      \end{empheq}
      The main difference of this source function is that it has three different and independent widths $R_{out}$, $R_{side}$, $R_{long}$ and they are defined in the LCMS, not in PRF.
      Unlike in PRF, in LCMS an equal-time approximation is not used.
      For identical particles this is not a problem - only Coulomb interaction inside a wave function depends on $\Delta t$.

      \subsubsection{Relationship between one-dimensional and three-dimensional source sizes}
      % ========
      Up to now, most of femtoscopic measurements were limited only to averaged source size $R^L_{av}$ (the letter ``L'' in superscript stands for LCMS):
      \begin{equation}
        S^{LCMS}_{1D} (\vect{r}) = \exp \left( - \frac{ {r_{out}}^{2} + {r_{side}}^{2} + {r_{long}}^{2}}{2 {R^{L}_{av}}^2} \right)~.
      \end{equation}
      The relationship between between $S^{LCMS}_{1D}(\cdot)$ and $S^{LCMS}_{3D}(\cdot)$ is given by:
      \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
        \label{eq:source-1d-from-3d}
        S^{LCMS}_{3D} (r) = \int \exp \left( 
          - \frac{ r_{out}^{2}}{2 {R^L_{out}}^2}
          - \frac{ r_{side}^{2}}{2 {R^L_{side}}^2}
          - \frac{ r_{long}^{2}}{2 {R^L_{long}}^2}
        \right)
        \\ \times~\delta \left(
          r - \sqrt{ r_{out}^{2} + r_{side}^{2} + r_{long}^{2}}
        ~\right)
        d r_{out} d r_{side} d r _{long}~.
        \end{split}
      \end{equation}
      The one-dimensional source size corresponding to the three-dimensional one can be approximated by the following form:
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:source-1d-lcms}
        S^{LCMS}_{1D} (r) = {r}^{2} \exp \left( - \frac{r^{2}}{2 {R^L_{av}}^2} \right)~.
      \end{equation}
      The equation above assumes that $R^L_{out} = R^L_{side} = R^L_{long}$ hence $R^L_{av} = R^L_{out}$.
      \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{3dg21d}
        \caption{An averaged three-dimensional Gaussian source function with different widths was averaged into one-dimensional function. To illustrate deformations, one-dimensional Gaussian distribution was fitted.}
        \label{fig:3dgaussian}
      \end{figure}
      If this condition is not satisfied, one can not give explicit mathematical relation between one-dimensional and three-dimensional source sizes.
      However, for realistic values of $R$ (i.e. for similar values of $R_{out}$, $R_{side}$, $R_{long}$), the $S^{LCMS}_{3D}$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:source-1d-from-3d} is not very different from Gaussian distribution and can be well approximated by Eq.~\ref{eq:source-1d-from-3d}.

      A deformation of an averaged source function in case of big differences in $R_{out}$, $R_{side}$, $R_{long}$ is presented in the Fig.~\ref{fig:3dgaussian}.
      A three-dimensional Gaussian distribution with varying widths was averaged into one-dimensional function using the Eq.~\ref{eq:source-1d-from-3d}.
      Afterwards, an one-dimensional Gaussian distribution was fitted.
      One can notice a heavy tail of an averaged distribution in long $r$ region, which makes an approximation using one-dimensional distribution in this case quite inaccurate.
      
      Using Eq.~\ref{eq:source-1d-from-3d} and Eq.~\ref{eq:source-1d-lcms} one can obtain a relation between one-dimensional width and the three-dimensional ones.
      Through numerical calculations one can find the following approximate relation~\cite{nonidfemto}:
      \begin{empheq}[innerbox=\fbox, right=~.]{align}
        R^{L}_{av} = \sqrt{ \left. \left( {R^L_{out}}^2 + {R^L_{side}}^2 + {R^L_{long}}^2 \right) \middle/ 3 \right. }
      \end{empheq}
      This equation does not depend on the pair velocity, hence it is valid in the LCMS and PRF.

    \subsection{Theoretical correlation function}
    % ========
      The fundamental object in a particle interferometry is a correlation function.
      The correlation function is defined as:
      \begin{equation}
        C(\vect{p}_a,\vect{p}_b) = \frac{P_2(\vect{p}_a,\vect{p}_b)}{P_1(\vect{p}_a) P_1(\vect{p}_b)}~,
      \end{equation}
      where $P_2$ is a conditional probability to observe a particle with momentum $\vect{p}_b$ if particle with momentum $\vect{p}_b$ was also observed.
      A $P_1$ is a probability to observe a particle with a given momentum.
      The relationship between source emission function, pair wave function and the correlation function is described by the following equation:
      \begin{equation}
        C(\vect{p}_1,\vect{p}_2) = \int S_{AB}(\vect{p}_1,\vect{x}_1,\vect{p}_2,\vect{x}_2)
          |\Psi_{AB}|^2 d^4 \vect{x}_1 d^4 \vect{x}_2
      \end{equation}
      Substituting the one-dimensional emission function (Eq.~\ref{eq:source-1d-prf}) into the integral above yields the following form of correlation function in PRF:
      \begin{empheq}[innerbox=\fbox, right=~,]{align}
        C(q) = 1 + \lambda \exp \left( - R_{inv}^2 q^2 \right)
      \end{empheq}
      where $q$ is a momentum difference between two particles.
      When using the three-dimensional emission function (Eq.~\ref{eq:source-3d-lcms}) one gets the following correlation function defined in the LCMS:
      \begin{empheq}[innerbox=\fbox, right=~,]{align}
        C(\vect{q}) = 1+ \lambda \exp \left( -R_{out}^2 q_{O}^2 -R_{side}^2 q_{S}^2 -R_{long}^2 q_{L}^2  \right)
      \end{empheq}
      where $q_O$, $q_S$, $q_L$ are $\vect{q}$ components in the outward, sideward and longitudinal direction.
      The $\lambda$ parameter in the equations above determines correlation strength.
      The lambda parameter has values in the range $\lambda \in [-0.5,1]$ and it depends on a pair type.
      In case of pairs of identical bosons (like $\pi$-$\pi$ or $K$-$K$) the lambda parameter $\lambda \to 1$. For identical fermions (e.g. $p$-$p$) $\lambda \to$~-0.5.
      Values of $\lambda$ observed experimentally are lower than 1 (for bosons) and greater than -0.5 (for fermions).
      There are few explanations to this effect: detector efficiencies, inclusion of misidentified particles in a used sample or inclusion of non-correlated pairs (when one or both particles come from e.g. long-lived resonance).
      The analysis carried out in this work uses data from a model, therefore the detector efficiency and particle purity is not taken into account~\cite{nonidfemto}.
    %

    \subsection{Spherical harmonics decomposition of a correlation function}
    % ========
      Results coming from an analysis using three-dimensional correlation function in Cartesian coordinates are quite difficult to visualize.
      To do that, one usually performs a projection into a one dimension in outward, sideward and longitudinal directions. 
      One may loose important information about a correlation function in this procedure, because it gives only a limited view of the full three-dimensional structure.
      Recently, a more advanced way of presenting correlation function - a spherical harmonics decomposition, was proposed.
      The three-dimensional correlation function is decomposed into an infinite set of components in a form of one-dimensional histograms $C^m_l (q)$.
      In this form, a correlation function is defined as a sum of a series~\cite{sh}:
      \begin{equation}
        C(\vect{q}) = \sum_{l,m} C^m_l (q) Y^m_l(\theta, \phi)~,
      \end{equation}
      where $Y^m_l(\theta,\phi)$ is a spherical harmonic function.
      Spherical harmonics are an orthogonal set of solutions to the Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates
      Hence, in this approach, a correlation function is defined as a function of $q$, $\theta$ and $\phi$.
      To obtain $C^m_l$ coefficients in the series, one has to calculate the following integral:
      \begin{equation}
        C^m_l(q) = \int_\Omega C(q,\theta,\phi) Y^m_l (\theta,\phi) d \Omega~,
      \end{equation}
      where $\Omega$ is a full solid angle.

      Spherical harmonics representation has several important advantages.
      The main advantage of this decomposition is that it requires less statistics than traditional analysis performed in Cartesian coordinates.
      Another one is that it encodes full three-dimensional information in a set of one-dimensional plots. 
      In principle it does not have to be an advantage, because full description of a correlation function requires infinite number of \textit{l}, \textit{m} components.
      But it so happens that the intrinsic symmetries of a pair distribution in a femtoscopic analysis result in most of the components to vanish.
      For the identical particles correlation functions, all coefficients with odd values of \textit{l} and \textit{m} disappear.
      % Because the values of a correlation function are real, the imaginary part of a series are equal to zero ($\Im C^m_l = 0$).
      It has also been shown, that the most significant portion of femtoscopic data is stored in the components with the lowest \textit{l} values.
      It is expected that, the main femtoscopic information is contained in the following components~\cite{nonidfemto}:
      \begin{align}
        C^0_0 &\to R_{LCMS}~, \\
        \Re C^0_2 &\to \frac{R_T}{R_{long}}~, \\
        \Re C^2_2 &\to \frac{R_{out}}{R_{side}}~,
      \end{align}
      where $R_{LCMS} = \sqrt{ \left. \left( {R_{out}}^2 + {R_{side}}^2 + {R_{long}}^2 \right) \middle/ 3 \right. }$ and $R^{T} = \sqrt{ \left. \left( R_{out}^2 + R_{side}^2 \right) \middle/2 \right. }$.
      The $C^0_0$ is sensitive to the overall size of a correlation function.
      The $\Re C^0_2$ carries the information about the ratio of the transverse to the longitudinal radii, due to its $\cos^2(\theta)$ weighting in $Y^0_2$.
      The component $\Re C^2_2$ with its $\cos^2(\phi)$ weighting encodes the ratio between outward and sideward radii.
      Thus, the spherical harmonics method allows to obtain and analyze full three-dimensional femtoscopic information from a correlation function~\cite{nonidfemto}.
